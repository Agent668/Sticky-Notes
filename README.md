# Sticky-Notes

## Description
Sticky Notes is a simple program I am working on. It is made in python using the pygame library. It isn't the cleanest right now and it lacks many features I want but those will come with future updates. I am making this to fix the lack of certain features that many other sticky note programs have.

## Features (way more comming soon)
- write text on a small window
- choose between 2 color modes

## How to install
After downloading the ZIP, extract it and IF you DON'T HAVE python and/or pygame(THIS IS REQUIRED) installed(or dont know if you do), go to this link and download python and install it: "https://www.python.org/downloads/" then open the "Installers" folder after python is installed, I have made a quick batch file you can simply launch named "install_pygame" to install the pygame library.

## How to use
After following the install process above, simply launch the "start.py" (or "start" if you dont have file name extensions). If you encounter any problems launching, make sure you followed all the steps in the install guide. *also dont close the cmd window cuz it will kill the program

## Bugs
If you find any bugs please contact me. (dont confuse bugs with the lack of a feature, I only just wrote the barely working version so you cant even write capital letters yet...)

## Development News
### Version V1.1:
Added capital letters (toggle by pressing shift cuz fuck caps lock), added text location indicator that blinks so you know where youre typing.
